## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Classification-Model.git
   cd Image-Classification-Model

    Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the dataset
Place your training and validation images in a directory like:

    data/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── class1/
    │   ├── class2/
    └── validation/
        ├── class1/
        ├── class2/

▶️ How to Run

Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute all cells:

jupyter notebook model(2).ipynb

Or run in VS Code / Colab if preferred.
